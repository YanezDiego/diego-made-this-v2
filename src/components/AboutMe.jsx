        With three years of experience as a freelance full-stack software
        engineer, I have gained expertise in various languages and frameworks
        such as JavaScript, SQL, Ruby, TypeScript, HTML/HTML5, CSS/SCSS, React,
        Gatsby, Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, and LINQ. Throughout my career, I have
        had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, collaborating with
        cross-functional teams to create user-friendly websites and web
        applications. I am particularly passionate about accessibility and have
        utilized tools like screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color
        contrast checkers to test and improve accessibility in my work. In my
        previous roles, I have been responsible for tasks such as gathering
        customer data, automating reporting tools, and developing back-end APIs
        using technologies like Node.js and MongoDB. I have also led the
        development of front-end features, utilizing frameworks like React and
        GraphQL to enhance user experiences. Additionally, I have had the
        privilege of working as a technical coach, where I provided support to
        students at all levels of their curriculum. This experience allowed me
        to further refine my skills and contribute to the development of a
        comprehensive online curriculum. I am enthusiastic about creating
        innovative solutions and delivering exceptional results. If you are
        looking for a friendly and skilled software engineer to contribute to
        your project, I would love to connect and discuss how I can be of
        assistance.
